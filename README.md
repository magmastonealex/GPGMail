# GPGMail

Through apps like OpenKeychain, modern PGP operations are simple and secure on Android.
But one of the largest uses for PGP - encrypted email - is missing a great, modern client.
K-9 mail and others, though they implement integrations with OpenKeychain, leave a lot to be desired in UI and modern conveniences.

This is a project to change all of that.

GPGMail aims to be a clean, ground-up mail app which securely integrates with OpenKeychain to provide the best encrypted mail experience on Android.
